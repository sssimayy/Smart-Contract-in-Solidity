# Smart-Contract-in-Solidity


Main Task: Smart contracts will be developed in Solidity and a central contact with a counter will 
be incremented on the Ethereum Test Network Rinkeby.

Develop  a  smart  contract,  and  then  set  their  contract  address  to  the  Central 
Contract by calling the function  “setTeamContract”. This operation can be realized only with the 
team own account.

The  contract  name  is  CommonCounterContract.  The  address  of  the  contract  is 
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

The  contract  CommonCounterContract  has  a  function  “getMyTeamContract”.  Each  team  can 
learn their active contract address using it.

The contract CommonCounterContract has a function named “getCounter”. This function can be 
called from the team account with a 0.1 Test Ether, and it returns the current counter value. 

The contract CommonCounterContract  has a function  named “incrementCounter”.  This function 
can be called from the team account with a 0.5 Test Ether, it takes the last counter value,  and if 
the counter value is correct, it increments the counter by 1.

Each  team  can  learn  their  total  increment  count  using the  function  “getMyTeamCount”  of the 
contract CommonCounterContract.
